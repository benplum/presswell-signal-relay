Capture UTM and click tracking parameters across a visitor session.

== Description ==

Presswell Tracking Signal Relay captures attribution parameters and stores them with supported form plugin submissions. The plugin reads query parameters from the current URL, merges them with stored values, and keeps them available for later form views during the same visitor session.

Supported Form Plugins:

* Gravity Forms
* WPForms
* Fluent Forms
* Contact Form 7
* Forminator
* Formidable Forms

**Features**

* Captures common attribution parameters and stores them with submissions
* Tracks `utm_source`, `utm_medium`, `utm_campaign`, `utm_content`, `utm_term`, `gclid`, `fbclid`, `msclkid`, `ttclid`, `landing_page`, `landing_query`, and `referrer`
* Persists values in browser localStorage for the visitor session (1-hour TTL by default)
* Automatically populates hidden field inputs when forms render

***Capture Methods***

* Gravity Forms: Custom field type (`presswell_transceiver`) that users add from the builder.
* WPForms: Custom field type (`presswell_transceiver`) that users add from the builder.
* Fluent Forms: Custom field type (`presswell_transceiver`) that users add from the builder.
* Contact Form 7: HTML injection. Hidden tracking inputs are appended during form render.
* Forminator: HTML injection. Hidden tracking inputs are appended during form render.
* Formidable Forms: Custom field type (`presswell_transceiver`) that users add from the builder.

**pwtsr_tracking_keys( $keys, $context )**

* **$keys** (array) (required) - Ordered list of tracking keys that should be captured and stored with each entry.
* **$context** (string) (required) - Adapter context (`core`, `gravityforms`, `wpforms`, `fluentforms`, `contactform7`, `forminator`, or `formidable`).
* Return an indexed array of string keys.
* These values are used to build hidden inputs and entry-detail output.

Example:

`
add_filter( 'pwtsr_tracking_keys', function( $keys, $context ) {
    if ( 'gravityforms' !== $context ) {
        return $keys;
    }
    $keys[] = 'custom_param';
    $keys[] = 'utm_id';
    return $keys;
}, 10, 2 );
`

**pwtsr_tracking_ttl( $ttl, $context )**

* **$ttl** (int) (required) - Session storage lifetime in seconds. Default is `3600` (1 hour).
* **$context** (string) (required) - Adapter context (`core`, `gravityforms`, `wpforms`, `fluentforms`, `contactform7`, `forminator`, or `formidable`).
* Return a positive integer. Invalid values automatically fall back to the default TTL.

Example:

`
add_filter( 'pwtsr_tracking_ttl', function( $ttl, $context ) {
    if ( 'core' !== $context ) {
        return $ttl;
    }
    return DAY_IN_SECONDS * 7;
}, 10, 2 );
`

**pwtsr_storage_key( $storage_key, $context )**

* **$storage_key** (string) (required) - Browser storage key used for the attribution payload.
* **$context** (string) (required) - Adapter context (`core`, `gravityforms`, `wpforms`, `fluentforms`, `contactform7`, `forminator`, or `formidable`).
* Return a non-empty string.

**Default Tracking Keys**

* `utm_source`
* `utm_medium`
* `utm_campaign`
* `utm_content`
* `utm_term`
* `gclid`
* `fbclid`
* `msclkid`
* `ttclid`
* `landing_page`
* `landing_query`
* `referrer`

== Installation ==

Install via the WordPress plugin installer or manually upload the folder to `wp-content/plugins/`.

1. Activate the plugin.
2. If using Gravity Forms, edit a form and add the **Tracking** field from *Advanced Fields*.
3. If using WPForms, edit a form and add the **Tracking** field.
4. If using Fluent Forms, edit a form and add the **Tracking** field.
5. If using Forminator, publish a custom form (tracking inputs are injected automatically).
6. If using Contact Form 7, publish any form (tracking inputs are injected automatically).
7. If using Formidable, edit a form and add the **Tracking** field.
8. Send traffic with UTM/click parameters.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What parameters are tracked by default? =

UTM parameters (`utm_source`, `utm_medium`, `utm_campaign`, `utm_content`, `utm_term`), common ad click IDs (`gclid`, `fbclid`, `msclkid`, `ttclid`), plus `landing_page`, `landing_query`, and `referrer`.

= Does this require custom JavaScript in my theme? =

No. The plugin injects and populates tracking inputs automatically when supported forms render. 

= How long is attribution data stored? =

By default, one hour. You can change the TTL with the `pwtsr_tracking_ttl` filter.

= Can I track additional custom parameters? =

Yes. Use the `pwtsr_tracking_keys` filter to add or remove keys.

= Why isn't my form plugin supported? =

We plan to support additional form ecosystems, but each integration requires reliable extension points for hidden field rendering, submission lifecycle hooks, entry persistence, and token/merge-tag resolution. Some form plugins do not expose these capabilities consistently enough to deliver a production-ready adapter. We are also prioritizing support for plugins with transparent licensing, complete core functionality, and a respectful user experience.
